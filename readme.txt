Title of Project : "Head and Tail command"
Name : Vaishnavi K. Madane
MIS ID : 141608005


Overview:
"Head and Tail command." The Head command reads the first few lines of any text given to it as an input and writes them to standard output (which, by default, is the display screen). The square brackets indicate that the enclosed items are optional. By default, head returns the first ten lines of each file name that is provided to it.The linux Tail command does something like its name. It displays the last few lines of a file. 

Steps:
1. type "make" command in terminal. (make sure that you are in directory that contain its Makefile and all project files.)
2. It will create "head.o" and "tail.o".
3. User have to follow the usage instructions properly for both the commands and you will get the corect output.
4. Head will print the first specified number of lines of a particular file as per user's input. So as tail command but it prints the last lines.
